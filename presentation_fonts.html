                <h3>Font Stack Contains: </h3>
                    <li>A list of fonts to use in your CSS!</li>
                    <li>Fonts are listed in order of preference.</li>
                    <li>Allows you to design a website with fonts you choose, and will give the user these fonts</li>
                    <li>Find out more on: <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/font-stack-definition-3467414" target="_blank">ThoughtCo.</a></li>

            <ul>
                <h3>Controlling space between letters</h3>
                <li>First Intance of this List will have .3rem of spacing between letters</li>
                <li>This will have normal spacing</li>
                <li>The last instance of this list will have 1px of spacing</li>
            </ul>
        <p> This is achieved by using the property &quot;letter-spacing&quot; in a selector. I also put the CSS pseudo-class of :first-of-type on the parent child of ul li!</p>
