<p>Shakespeare said: <q>All the World's a stage.</q></p>
<blockquote>
    All the world’s a stage,<br>
    And all the men and women merely players;<br>
    They have their exits and their entrances,<br>
    And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
    His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,<br>
    Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.<br>
    Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel<br>
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br>
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br>
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br>
    Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br>
    Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,<br>
    Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br>
    Seeking the bubble reputation<br>
    Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,<br>
    In fair round belly with good capon lined,<br>
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br>
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br>
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br>
    Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,<br>
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;<br>
    His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide<br>
    For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,<br>
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br>
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br>
    That ends this strange eventful history,<br>
