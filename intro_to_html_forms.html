<h1>Welcome to Intro to HTML Forms</h1>
<!-- HTML forms are defined by using the <form> element.
The example below shows a couple attributes specified on the <form> element, and
the form is made up of several input elements.
METHOD = the method attribute of a <form> element refers ot the HTTP method that
should be used to transmit the form data. If no method is specified, by default, the GET method will be used.
While other HTTP methods exist, the html specification limits us to using GET and
POST in forms.

GETs = are us to request information, without making any changes to data on the server.
When a form's method is set to GET, any of the data that the form sends will be appended to the url in the form of a query string.

POSTS = are used to make a change to existing data on the server. When a form's method is set to POST, any of the data that the form sends will no be added to the url,
but will instead by embedded in the body of the HTTP request as key-value pairs.
If you have ever been asked a question like, "Are you sure you want to re-submit this form?", then you were probably refreshing a page after submitting an HTTP POST.

Action = The action attribute of an HTML <form> refers ot the location that the form data should be sent.
If no action is specified, by default, the action will be set to send data back to the current url.

Query Strings = composed of key-value pairs. It begins with a question mark (?), following the question mark, is the first key-value pair. Key-value pairs are structured as key=value. Key-vlaue pairs after the first will be separated by ampersand (&).
Here is an Example:
?key1=value1&key2=value2&key3=value3

More notes on GET method = Whenever you use the GET method in an HTML form, the form
inputs will be appended to the url in the format shown above. if you are using a POST method
in an HTML form, the inputs will be sent as a query string (this time without the preceding question mark) in the body of the HTTP request.
The following anchor tag example and form example send a very similar GET request.
If you put 78205 in the text input, then the form below sends the same key, which is zipcode, and hte same value, the value 78205

COMMON FORM INPUTS = Basic Text input elements is an <input> element with a type of "text"
Can optionally specify a placeholder attribute.
Setting the attribute type to password will hide whatever the user enters

        The contents of an option element are what the user sees, and the value
        attribute is the data that is submitted as part of the form.

    <h4>Disabled</h4>
        <!--A <disabled attribute can be added to any of the below elements to

    <h3>Labels</h3>
    <!--The <label> is used to label form inputs. Label elements should have
    a  "for" attribute that matches up with the "id" attribute of the element
    that is being labeled. When a form input is properly labeled, clicking on
    the label will focus that input element. this is particularly useful for
    checkboxes and radio buttons, and it is a common practice to wrap checkbox
    and radio <input>'s with a <label>-->
